# Data Science Projects
## [1. Estimation of Future Profits for Venture Capital Investors](https://github.com/osamayusufhassan/VC_profit_estimator_multiple_linear_regression)
‚Ä¢ Problem Statement: A VC firm is holding a board meeting to assess the potentials of profitability in the current market. Create a model to estimate the future profits for venture capitalists in order to assist them in making the right investment.<br />
‚Ä¢	Skills Accomplished: Python, sci-kit learn (Linear Regression, train_test_split), pandas, numpy, maltplotlib, OneHotEncoder, Model Evaluation using R-squared metric.<br />
‚Ä¢	Tools Used: Jupyter Notebook for Python, Microsoft Excel.<br />
‚Ä¢ Predictive modelling via Multiple Linear Regression to predict score achieved by a student based upon R&D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend and State.<br />
‚Ä¢	Achieved an R-2 score =0.93 as a measure of goodness of fit of the model.
<br />
## [2. SUV Purchase Predictor](https://github.com/osamayusufhassan/SUV-purchase-prediction-logistic-regression)
‚Ä¢ Problem Statement: The executives of an automobile company are meeting to decide whether or not they should continue the assembly of one of their SUV models. Create a model to predict the demand of SUV among  different age groups and pay scales.<br />
‚Ä¢	Skills Accomplished: R, Logistic Regression, Confusion Matrix, Feature Scaling, caTools for splitting data set.<br />
‚Ä¢	Tools Used: RStudio for R, Microsoft Excel.<br />
‚Ä¢	Built and trained Logistic Regression model to predict whether or not the customers will purchase the newly launched SUV based on features such as age and salary.<br />
## [3. Prediction of Student Test Scores](https://github.com/osamayusufhassan/Linear-Regression-hours-vs-scores)
‚Ä¢ Problem Statement: Create a model to predict the test scores of a class.<br />
‚Ä¢	Skills Accomplished: Python, sci-kit learn (Linear Regression, train_test_split), Model Evaluation using various metrics (mean absolute error, mean squared error, RMS and R-squared).<br />
‚Ä¢	Tools Used: Jupyter Notebook for Python, Microsoft Excel.<br />
‚Ä¢ Trained a Linear Regression model to predict the test scores achieved by a student based upon respective hours of study.<br />
‚Ä¢	Achieved an R-2 score =0.945 as a measure of goodness of fit of the model.
<br />
## [4. Home Price Estimator](https://github.com/osamayusufhassan/Decision_tree_regressor_price_predictor)
‚Ä¢ Problem Statement: A real estate agent wants to understand the pricing criteria of homes built in a certain locality. Create a model to estimate the home prices based upon a number of features as shown in the data set.<br />
‚Ä¢	Skills Accomplished: Python, sci-kit learn (DecisionTreeRegressor, train_test_split, mean_absolute_error), pandas, numpy, Model Validation using Mean Absolute Error metric.<br />
‚Ä¢	Tools Used: Jupyter Notebook for Python, Microsoft Excel.<br />
‚Ä¢ Built and trained a model to estimate home prices via Decision Tree Regressor of sci-kit learn library.<br />
‚Ä¢ Performed model validation and handled overfitting vs underfitting to minimize mean absolute error.<br />
